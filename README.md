# js-starter with react

* I implemented all the basic functionalities. Most things worked for me.

* I did 2 Extra Credits, one is styling and another one is input validation. If the user
fails to put down all the required values when creating new post, console would log
the error message and postCreate() function won't be called. The browser won't be
pushed to the home page, instead would stay on the new page.
